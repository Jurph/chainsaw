# Lesson 00

For this lesson, you won't need to do any programming at all. You're going to be setting up your
development environment.

A typical development environment includes (among other things):

* a place to store the programs you're working on
* the software used to write, compile, run, and debug programs
* information about the libraries your programs will rely on

# Workspace

**Exercise:** _Create a new folder somewhere on your computer for storing all your projects._
Someplace in the "Documents" or "My Documents" folder seems to work for a lot of people. Others
like to store their programs on a separate drive.

It helps to keep all your projects next to each other because often times you'll be going back
and forth between several, trying to re-use parts.

Future lessons will refer to your workspace directory as "myapps." You don't have to use this name
and nothing will break if you name it something else.

These lessons are also going to use forward slashes (/) between the directories in a path. If
you're on Unix or Mac, this will feel familiar. If you're on Windows, where backslash (\) is
standard, just substitute as necessary.

# IDE

Between the era of punchcards and the first dot-com bubble, most programs were written in text
editors like `vi`, `EDIT.COM`. These days, that's a pretty crummy way to enter code.

Almost every language these days has an _integrated development environment_ (IDE) available for
it. Usually several. An IDE combines a smart text editor (that manages a lot of the formatting for
the developer and color-codes everything to make it easier to read), a compiler/interpreter, a
debugger, and prerequisite-management tools. They're a one-stop-shop for software development.

**Exercise:** _Download and install an IDE for Python._ Most of the lessons in this project were
designed using PyCharm, which has a free (community) version available here:
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/  (If you're feeling adventurous, you can install the
30-day trial of the professional version but nothing we do in these lessons will require features
that are only in the pro edition.)

You can use another IDE but we won't have any idea how to help you out if something doesn't work
right.

# Objectives

If you read this whole absurdly long document, you've hopefully done the following:

* Created a workspace directory
* Downloaded and installed an Integrated Development Environment, probably PyCharm
